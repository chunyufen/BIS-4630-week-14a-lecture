# COSO

&gt; "The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) was formed in 1985 to make recommendations on how companies and auditors should identify and attack fraudulent financial reporting. COSO consist of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the American Accounting Association, Financial Executives International, the Institute of Management Accountants, and the Institute of Internal Auditors."

---

# 1992 COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework

&gt; "In 1992, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) developed a model for evaluating internal controls. This model has been adopted as the generally accepted framework for internal control and is widely recognized as the definitive standard against which organizations measure the effectiveness of their systems of internal control."

---

# 1992 COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework

* Internal Control

&gt; "Is a process, effected by an entity’s board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives related to operations, reporting and compliance"

* Three dimensions of a cube: objectives, components and entity units

---

# 1992 COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework

&lt;img src="images/coso-cube-1992.png" height="400pt" /&gt;

---

# 1992 COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework

&gt; "The COSO model defines internal control as “a process, effected by an entity’s board of directors, management and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance of the achievement of objectives in the following categories:"

&gt; "Effectiveness and efficiency of operations"

&gt; "Reliability of financial reporting"

&gt; "Compliance with applicable laws and regulations" 

---

# 1992 COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework

&gt; "In an “effective” internal control system, the following five mission, strategies and related business objectives."

* 5 integrated components of internal control:

    + "Control Environment"

    + "Risk Assessment"

    + "Control Activities"

    + "Information and Communication"

    + "Monitoring"

---

# 1992 COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework

* 3 categories of objectives

    + Operations
    
    + Reporting
    
    + Compliance

---

# SOA (2002)

&gt; "The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 recommends the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) model as a means for companies to identify and mitigate risk that can lead to financial misstatement."

---

# COSO - ERM (2004)

* [COSO-ERM (Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework)](http://bit.ly/2scmwwW) 2004

&gt; "COSO defines Enterprise Risk Management as follows: “Enterprise Risk Management is a process, effected by an entity’s board of directors, management and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and across enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect the entity, and manage risk to be within its risk appetite, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of entity objectives”"

---

# COSO - ERM (2004)

&gt; "The COSO-ERM framework is illustrated in Figure 2, showing its three dimensions: objectives, components and entity units. ERM is said to be effective when the eight components are present and functioning effectively in each of the four objectives, providing reasonable assurance to management about the achievement of the objectives."

# 2017 ERM Framework Update

* [COSO Enterprise Risk Management—Integrating with Strategy and Performance](http://bit.ly/2gMHHR1)

&gt; "Our understanding of the nature of risk, the art and science of choice, lies at the core of our modern economy. Every choice we make in the pursuit of objectives has its risks. From day-today operational decisions to the fundamental trade-offs in the boardroom, dealing with risk in these choices is a part of decision-making. "

&gt; "Organizations need to be more adaptive to change. They need to think strategically about how to manage the increasing volatility, complexity, and ambiguity of the world, particularly at the senior levels in the organization and in the boardroom where the stakes are highest."

---

# 2017 ERM Framework Update

# Before You Join a Board: 21 Essential Question

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* Question

    + Red flag

    + Gold standards

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (1) Do the chief executive officer (CEO) and the chief financial officer (CFO) exhibit unreserved *transparency*?

    + Detailed analyses of operating results are reserved for one board committee (e.g. the executive or financial committee) and are not given a full vetting among the total board membership.

    + The CEO and CFO provide detailed monthly comments to the full board on operating and financial results and entertain clarifying questions in plenary sessions of the board; directors have electronic access to periodic financial reports, just as do senior leaders of the organization.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (2) Is the organization's financial leverage modest, and is its source of incremental *financing* both trustworthy and reliable?

    + Borrowing is at or near maximum available credit; a majority of the current year's budgeted cash flow is committed to servicing desk.

    + Current borrowing utilizes 50% or less of agreed borrowing limits; the organization currently violates no borrowing covenants.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (3) Does voting *control* (or operating control) rest in a very few hands?

    + One investor (or contributor), whether explicitly or implicitly, has the latitude to direct the commitment of significant resources without the advance consideration and approval of the full board.

    + No individual owner or executive personally exercises control over decisions as to the sources and uses of the organization's people and money - the most scarce of resources, other than board time.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (4) Are financial statements *audited* by a highly reputable and independent firm?

    + Recent audits reveal the organization faces imminent audit qualifications or "going concern" reservations by outside auditors; or Financial statements are only compiled or reviewed by an outside firm, but they do not face the rigors of an outside audit.

    + Financial statements have been audited for 3+ ears by the same highly reputable and independent firm, and the auditors have expressed no reservations about the financial statements or about the long-term viability of the organization during those years.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (5) By what measures does the CEO define the *success* of the organization?

    + The CEO has a laundry list of financial measures from which he/she selects different indicators from time to time in keeping with changing priorities.

    + The CEO uses a succinct list of key performance indicators, tracks them closely, and regularly reports results to the senior leadership team and to the full board; the board concurs in the value of these measures.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (6) Are the board and senior management alert to the greatest *enterprise risks* to the organization?

    + Neither the board nor the audit committee has evaluated the organization's portfolio of risks, both operational and financial; the board and the CEO have not articulated and ratified a clear limit on risk appetite.

    + In keeping with COSO guidance, the board has formally assessed the organization's risk philosophy and stated its concurrence with the leadership's risk appetite; the board reviews key risk indicators with the CEO at every board meeting.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (7) Similarly, are the board and senior management attuned to the organization's "competiton"?

    + The CEO and the board regard the organization as having essentially no real competition because of the uniqueness of current offerings, capabilities, and strategic advantage.

    + The CEO regularly reviews competitive offerings with the board, and selected board committees regularly assess with the CEO the potential competitive threats to the future of the organization.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (8) What are the *professional time horizons* of the CEO and of the CFO?

    + No well-prepared successors are specifically known to the board; the board's only expectation is that an outside hire would be needed in the event of the sudden unavailability of the CEO or CFO.

    + The CEO and CFO have disclosed to the board their personal time horizons for service in their current positions; the CEO regularly reports to the board on the professional progress of the most likely successors to senior leadership positions.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (9) What would be the monetary and time *cost of replacing the to officers* in a pinch?

    + Leadership succession rarely appears on the agenda of the board and its executive committee, and the costs of replacing leadership are largely unknown; Moody's has identified "key man risk" as an issue associated with bond offerings and other borrowings.

    + The CEO provides the board with regular reports on bench strength for the two levels o direct report below the CEO, as well as potential outside candidates, should they be needed; the organization's regulatory reports disclose specific succession responsibilities and processes, without naming likely successors.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (10) Does the organization have a clearly articulated and rigorously executed *selling strategy*?

     + The selling organization accepts any available contact as a viable entree into a new sales opportunity, irrespective of the contact's demonstrable authority to buy; the organization believes it does not need to "sell" to anyone.

     + The functional head of sales and the CEO share a highly articulated view of the components of major sales, the steps required to close a sale, and the most likely legitimate buyers in any prospective customer's organization.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (11) Is the *security of sensitive data* well protected, both electronically and physically?

    + Password protecting data access are recorded in obvious places and available in ways that circumvent the adopted access control policy; portable external devices, such as thumb dries, are left unprotected; or the organization has no writen access control policy.

    + The organization has a well defined and written set of protocols controlling access to sensitive customer and financial data and assures data redundancy via secure off-site storage; the policy and protocols are well executed and monitored.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (12) Who manages large *customer relationships*, and how?

    + The senior leadership has limited knowledge and no active participation in securing and managing large and critical customer relationships; customers rarely if ever see senior leaders face to face.

    + The CEO knows the largest and longest-lived customers and regularly participates in the oversight of their ongoing relationship; the senior leadership understand the financial and reputational costs of losing a long-term customer.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (13) What is the organization's experience with and vulnerability to the *failure of a large customer*?

    + A short list of customers or constituents represents a large majority of cash inflow, and the elimination of even one such customer could cause an interruption in the business.

    + No single customer represents a serious threat to the organization because incoming revenues are widely dispersed among customers (or buyers or contributors).

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (14) Do customers and other major constituents have ready *access to the organization*?

    + Customer call-ins are met with long waiting times and multiple levels of automatic recordings, irrespective of the size and duration of the customer relationship; the board rarely, if ever, reviews information about customer feedback.

    + Customers have dedicated lines of communication into the organization and can reach a live and responsible person in a matter of seconds; the senior leadership regularly reviews customer feedback and often monitors incoming customer calls.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (15) Is the *role of the board* frequently reviewed, and is its effectiveness regularly evaluated?

    + Board members are not asked to leave the board for lack of contribution to governance but leave only of their own volition; board members face no effective term limits or limits to their service on other boards.

    + A board governance committee regularly reviews bylaws and committee charters for their applicability to strategic challenges; each committee conducts an annual assessment of its own contribution to the quality of governance.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (16) How does the board monitor the *tone of the organization* at the top, middle, and bottom?

    + The board learns about the internal climate and culture only by way of occasional board dinners with management convened at the time of board meetings; the CEO excuses evidence of a high pressure climate and culture "because that's the nature of the business".

    + The board sponsors and reviews a regular diagnostic analysis of the prevalence of upward and frank communication in the organization; the CEO regularly reports to the board on the emergency of the desired culture of responsibility and ethics throughout the organization.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (17) How do the board and the CEO monitor the organization's vulnerability to the loss of *critical talent*?

    + Results alone determine the likelihood of promotion, even at the costs of the development of a poor tone of mutual reciprocity within the organization; mutual reciprocity is foreign to the nature of internal communication in the organization (as in ". . . . mutual what?")

    + Senior leadership maintains and regularly reviews with the board its hierarchy of likely promotions, question marks, and likely exits among the pool of critical talen; the likelihood of promotion depends both on the results delivered and on the active embodiment of the organization's values.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (18) Do the board and senior leadership know how the organization would manage a large and *unexpected infusion of cash*? or a *sudden cash shortage*?

    + The CEO, in consultation with the board, responds reactively to unexpected cash inflows or shortfalls, and determines their disposition by emergency consideration of current priorities.

    + The CEO and the board's senior leadership have a mutually agreed and specific understanding of the "order at the well" in the event of a large and unanticipated change in cash position.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (19) How does the board manage the *pay and performance of the CEO* and other top officers?

    + The CEO attends all compensation committee meetings and organizes both the relevant comparative data and the board's conversation on pay and performance; the CEO understands better than anyone else on the board how the long-term incentive plans work.

    + The CEO submits an annual self-assessment to the board's executive committee based on both financial and values-based results; the board's executive (or compensation) committee has its own outside advisors on CEO and leadership compensation.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (20) Do board meetings maximize the *value of board member's time*?

    + Board meeting time is dominated by management's PowerPoint presentations of detailed materials distributed in advance; board membership exceeds 12, and full board dialogue is limited by the number of participants in each plenary meeting.

    + Time is reserved in executive session at every board meeting for the CEO to discuss what is keeping him/her awake at night; all board members have the opportunity to participate actively in discussions of substantive issues in each plenary session of the board.

---

# Make or break questions: red flags &amp; gold standards

* (21) Do all of the independent board members have outstanding personal and professional reputations for competence, collegiality, courage, and character?

    + The board has several members know to the long-time friends of the Chairman or the CEO; board members who are known to miss meetings or to attend without preparation continue to serve.

    + The board is composed of a consciously chosen group of fewer than ten, with well-defined professional and cognitive skills; the board members all have exceptional reputations for personal and professional integrity.
